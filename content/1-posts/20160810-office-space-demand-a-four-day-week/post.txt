'People are working longer and longer hours, yet wages are decreasing. These long hours are bad for our mental and physical health, bad for our relationships, and bad for our communities. We are meeting to do something about it: demand a four day week!'

Together with Wealth Press and Deptford Cinema we co-organised a screening of cult classic slacker film Office Space. This was followed by a group discussion opening up a community dialogue for the Demand a Shorter Working Week! campaign. Evening Class with be collaborating with WP on future events and the campaign in general, the current manifesto can be found (link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EEGyN0K30gqGqEt-219EMaruc4J_hDi2EMt2uQnOu3c text: here).
