EC designed a flyer and questionnaire for A Better Besson Street, a campaign for a proper consultation on Lewisham Council's plans to develop a private rented sector scheme on the empty Besson Street site.

A group of campaigners based at The Field, New Cross will be going around the neighbourhood to ask what people really think of the plans. Come and join us in being Lewisham's Consultation Team (Militant Wing).
