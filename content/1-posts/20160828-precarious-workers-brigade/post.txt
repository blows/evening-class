We are currently collaborating with Precarious Workers Brigade to design a publication of their latest research.

"Given the prominence of employability teaching in higher education, we see it as imperative that these spaces be used to encourage critical thinking and the development of alternatives. With this resource pack, we invite “employability educators” to politicise their teaching and foster critical, practical approaches to learning and the world of work".

Precarious Workers Brigade is a UK-based group of precarious workers in culture & education. They call out in solidarity with all those struggling to make a living in this climate of instability and enforced austerity.
