Evening Class participates in (link: https://www.facebook.com/DeptfordDebates/ text: Deptford Debates).

'The margin was slim, the turnout was high, the results are in: British voters have chosen Brexit. 

The outcome leaves the Tory Party divided and immediately forced Prime Minister David Cameron to resign. Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn faces challenges from the right of his own party. Scottish and Northern Irish leaders are calling for independence referendums. 

In local communities across the country, racism and fascism are on the rise. The referendum campaign saw Labour MP Jo Cox murdered by a man shouting ‘Britain First’. How can we respond to this incredibly volatile and potentially explosive situation?

We in Deptford must unite at a local level to defend migrants, people of colour, and workers. Together we will discuss the dangers, new and old, unleashed in a post-Brexit world.'
